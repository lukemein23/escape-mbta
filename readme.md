## The Game

Explore the Ruggles train station and embark on a journey to find the hidden treasure and escape the MBTA, all under an interactive escape room setting!
This digital escape room was designed by Abbie Tyler, Luke Meininger, Lulwa Alghanim, and Zakiya Sheikh.
It is inspired by “dive the game” which is an underwater diving game we remixed on glitch.
We hope you have as much fun playing as we did designing the game!

This game consists of 21 rooms, which can be navigated through cardinal directions (NORTH, EAST, WEST, SOUTH).
As you progress throughout the game, you will find interactive objects that you may use to your benefit.
Hints are embedded in some objects to help you move you forward in the interactive narrative.
There are three "stages" in the game: Ruggles, The Oak Grove Train, and the Downtown Crossing station.
The goal of the game is to escape the final stage, which will earn the player an unlimited Charlie Card.
